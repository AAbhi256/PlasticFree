# Material Library

![](./README-ref/example.gif)

This is an experimental sample project that aims to collect a number of Materials tested on Spectacles.

> **NOTE:**
> If you are familiar with **Lens Studio** development, you might be aware of the resources available in the [Asset Library](https://developers.snap.com/lens-studio/assets-pipeline/asset-library/asset-library-overview) regarding shaders and effects. Sometimes it might not be too explicit that some of the resources are also compatible with Spectacles. As we continue to increase the number of resources for Spectacles, we will be improving this sample and continue testing a wide range of shaders.

## Disclaimer

This is an experimental effort to officialize shader support on Spectacles. Keep in mind that using multiple material at once or render a large number of object with the same material can affect performance. We are always looking forward to hear your feedback.
